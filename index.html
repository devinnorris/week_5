      <h2>THIS IS WHERE YOUR HEADLINE GOES</h2>

    <p>well most people here don't like the shitty daily soaps that are shown 
      so most of the Younger generation watches mostly show from the US including 
      south park.And as for OSHO,he is a asshole cause he was a brain washing cult 
      leader that most sane people would want to avoid.</p>
   
    <p>I agree there was continuity before but it's never been as prominent. Some changes 
      stuck before like kenny dying, butters joining the gang, Clyde's references in Pandemic 
      when he's saying how something always happen when the boys are around, the disappearance 
      of chef etc but there weren't really week to week off-references from episodes in the 
      season. I also think it's a good change.</p>
   
    <p>Yea and Butters wasn't in school for a couple episodes for setting the school on fire 
      and the gym always has burn marks all over it. The show carries a lot more shit from one 
      episode to the next this season. I like it.</p>
